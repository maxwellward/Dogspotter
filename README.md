## What is Dogspotter?
Dogspotter is a leaderboard-based game where players take photos of dogs in the real world and submit them for points.  

[Join the Dogspotter Discord!](https://discord.gg/JFGsuaR3pG) üí¨

The project is written in JavaScript. It utilizes Firebase for data storage and the Google Vision API for automatic dog-detection.

The Dogspotter bot is not available to invite to your own Discord server, but you're free to self-host it with your own Firebase and Google Vision API credentials to play with your friends! See the [setup section](#setup) for a getting started guide.

## Issues

Please report any issues with the bot to either our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JFGsuaR3pG) (`/report`) or on the [issues page](https://github.com/maxwellward/Dogspotter/issues)!

Good-faith contributions are always welcome! This project is pretty simple, so if you're a new JavaScript developer or want to work on something simple, this is a good project for you. We also don't bite, so even if you're new we're happy to give constructive feedback on your contributions.
